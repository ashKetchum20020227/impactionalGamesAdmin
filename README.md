# Impactional Games Admin

This website was made parallet with the client website which is also available as a repository, during my tenure as an Assistant Backend Developer Intern at Impactional Games.
These websites were a prototype. These were individually developed by me from scracth.

Like the client website, this too is fully responsive. I have added some imaged showcasing it's responsiveness, while describing functionality itself.


## Functionality

1) Admin Login

   An admin given his credentials can log in to this website.

2) Admin Home Page

   Various graphs and numbers showing the no. of visits to the website today, no. of registered users, graphs showing the traffic today and another grpah showing the
   plot of registered users vs days.

   The admin can apply filters and display info and graphs of specific month, or year, or even a specific from and to date.
   The filters can also be applied to registered users and website visites to get the info of all usrs registered on a [articular day, month, year, and the no. of website
   visits accordingly. The website visit info shows the location of the info, which can be used to target specific country/state traffic.
